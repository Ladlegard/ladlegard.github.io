    <img src="images/haruka-t1.jpg" alt="Haruka Sakurai's appearance during the first trial of MILGRAM" />
    <p>
      Haruka sakurai is the first prisoner in the MILGRAM project.
      He's 19 years old and he has a sort of inferiority complex that
      appears to stem from his relationship with his single mother.
      He's taken a liking to another prisoner in a way that seems... a bit unhealthy.

      It's not completely clear just who his victim was at this moment. Some theorized victims include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>his mother</li>
      <li>the female friend(?) of his seen in <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7PJ__3OVDI">"Weakness"</a></li>
      <li>a brother that may or may not exist</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The wardens are trying, alright!?</p>
